In June 2022 I become rOpenSci Community Manager.  To do a good job in the role it is essential to know your community, so as soon I started I digged in reading our documentation, learning our processes and their metrics, making interviews with team-mates and community members.

In my previews experience working with scientific and technological communities of practice, I used a tool called Social Network Analysis to understand the interaction of the members and plan strategies around the activities. 

This blog post present how we have been using this tool for the management of the rOpenSci community.

## Community of Practice and Community Manager

A community manager in the context of a STEM community of practice is a person that facilitates the activities of the community and the interaction with their members.  Have responsibilities over task in technical, interpersonal, communication, program management and program development aspect.

> A community of practice is a group of people who **share a 
passion** for something that they **know 
how to do**, and who **interact regularly** 
in order to **learn how to do it better** -- _Etienne Wenger_

> A Community Manager **facilitates** the **activities** of a community and the **interactions** between **community members.** 
Community management may be considered as _“in-reach”_ rather than _“outreach”_ or public engagement. - CSCCE

rOpenSci is a community of practice and our passion is to build tools, resources, and social and technical infrastructure to enable open and reproducible research using R. We interact regularly in different activities and spaces in order to learn how to do it better.

## Community Iteractions and Connectivity

rOpenSci records a lot of data and generates statistics and summaries, for example, how many packages we reviewed, how many blog posts we wrote, how many community calls we organized and how many people came. This are very useful and show us an overal idea of our community and our activities.

Now, communities are built on connections, and those summaries and number don't give us many information about the growth and strength of professional and interpersonal connections in our community.

Know our community connectivity is useful to __plan targeted__ and __effective interventions__ to:

- improve collaborations.
- improve information flow.
- improve knowledge reuse.
- effective knowledge (co)creation.
- effective knowledge transfer.

We can try to answer questions at a given moment in time, for example:

- Who is connected to whom? Who is not connected?
- Where, and who, are the __hubs__?
- Where and about what are the __clusters__? Are there __silos__?

Or how thing changes over time:

- Are new __connection__ forming?
- Are new __patterns__ of connectivity forming?
- How was our network __before and after__ the introduction of an activity?

## Social Network Analysis

Here is where Social Networks Analysis comes into play. I'm not talking about instagram or mastodon here, I'm talking about networks build by individuals u organization that have some kind of relationship.

> Group of individuals who relate to others for a specific purpose, characterized by the existence of information flows.
